# paradox-reader
Python module to read Paradox ```.txt``` files used in Crusader Kings II, Europa Universalis IV, Stellaris, and Hearts of Iron IV

## What it Does
This code will read a Paradox ```.txt``` file so that it can be used within a Python script. It can also save the read ```.txt``` as a JSON file.

## Why
My originally goal was to create some kind of tool for creating random Stellaris empires given a specific government type or personality. Instead of manually writing a JSON or YAML file of the criteria of each government or personality, it made sense to find a way to read the criteria straight from the relevant .txt files.

## How Does it do That
Given a file this script will use regular expression substitutions to translate the ```.txt``` file text into valid JSON. The Paradox .txt file format is fairly permissive so several choices had to be made to jerry-rig it into Python:
* Duplicate keys are turned into lists
```
allow = {
  is_country_type = default
  OR = {
    AND = {
      has_ethic = "ethic_fanatic_militarist"
      OR = {
        has_ethic = "ethic_spiritualist"
        has_ethic = "ethic_egalitarian"
        has_ethic = "ethic_xenophile"
      }
    }
    AND = {
      has_ethic = "ethic_fanatic_xenophile"
      has_ethic = "ethic_militarist"
    }
  }
}
```
Turns into:
```json
"allow": {
  "is_country_type": "default",
  "OR": {
    "AND": [
      {
        "has_ethic": "ethic_fanatic_militarist",
        "OR": {
          "has_ethic": [
            "ethic_spiritualist",
            "ethic_egalitarian",
            "ethic_xenophile"
          ]
        }
      },
      {
        "has_ethic": [
          "ethic_fanatic_xenophile",
          "ethic_militarist"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
* Greater than and less than comparisions get turned into objects:
```
happened = {
  num_owned_planets > 1
}
```
Turns into
```json
"num_owned_planets": {
  "value": 1,
  "operand": ">"
}
```

## Disclaimers
I am in no way affiliated with Paradox, nor do I have any knowledge on how they use these ```.txt``` files. Therefore I make no guarantees that this will correctly translate any given file, this has only been tested on a few files from Stellaris.
